# 🧩 MCP Widget RFCs

This repo contains proposals and specifications for extending the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with **MCP Widgets** — a way to bring structured, branded, interactive UIs into AI conversations.

## 📖 What’s Here?

- All proposals live in the `rfcs/` directory
- Each RFC is a Markdown file, named with a number and slug: `0001-my-rfc.md`
- Start with [RFC 0001: MCP Widget Extension](./rfcs/0001-mcp-widget-extension.md)

## 🧠 Why MCP Widgets?

Today, MCP enables structured actions in AI models — but the response layer is limited to plain text. This repo explores ways to enrich model outputs with micro frontends: widgets that can render checkout flows, dashboards, forms, etc. inside the chat UI.

## ✍️ Submitting a Proposal

1. Copy `0000-template.md`
2. Rename it as `rfcs/xxxx-your-title.md` (use the next available number)
3. Open a pull request
4. Label your PR with `rfc`, `draft`, or `proposal`

We welcome early ideas and half-baked concepts! Feedback is how they get better.
