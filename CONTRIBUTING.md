## 🧭 What’s an RFC?

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a design document that proposes a new feature, extension, or standard within the MCP Widget ecosystem. It provides:
- Context and motivation
- A detailed design
- Discussion of alternatives, tradeoffs, and implementation plan

We aim to make these RFCs collaborative and iterative — you don’t need everything figured out to propose something!
